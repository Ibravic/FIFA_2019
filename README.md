- seaborn
- sklearn

## Procedures
During the project the following steps are conducted:
- Read the dataset of "FIFA_2019"
- Data wrangling through solving the problem of missing data and data formatting
- Descriptive statistics
- Linear regression model
- Multiple regression model
- Pipeline
- Finally, choose the best regression model to be used in predicting the values of new players.
